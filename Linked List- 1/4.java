/*
Remove N-th node from the end of a Linked List 

Brute force - find size and then go to (size - n - 1) to remove it. O(2n)

Optimised- Two PTR Approach, 
    We know, that the n-th node from the end is the same as (total nodes â€“ n)th node from start.
    We take two pointers- fast and slow (start from one node previous of Head  dummy->head->.....)
    first we make sure that fast will point at nth node from start
    Ex- 1 2 3 4 5 and n - 2 (So we wnat to delete 4)
    fast = 2

    now once fast is fixed now time to make slow also on correct position
    start slow from head and go till fast.next != null;

    so,

    fast -> 5
    slow -> 3
    so slow reach at correct pos to delete 4
    Intuition- fast and slow it at gap n, so if fast is at end slow is at nth from end node
